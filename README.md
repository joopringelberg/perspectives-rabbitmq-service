# perspectives-rabbitmq-service
A simple service that proxies a request for registration to a local RabbitMQ server. It should itself be a back-end service that a solid HTTP server such as Apache proxies to.

The Perspectives Distributed Runtime (PDR) is written such that it assumes that this service is available on the endpoint `/rbsr`. Apache must be configured to pass any request to this endpoint to the local service that can be spun up using the program given in this module. Here is a suitable Apache conf section:

```
    <Location "/rbsr/">
      # Handle OPTIONS requests (preflight requests)
      <If "%{REQUEST_METHOD} == 'OPTIONS'">
          SetHandler default-handler
          Require all granted
          RewriteEngine On
          RewriteRule ^ - [R=204,L]
      </If>

      # Send on to the actual service:
      ProxyPass http://localhost:5988
      ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:5988
    </Location>
```

The PDR runs in a SharedWorker and specifies the content-type for requests to this service as application/json. For this reason, the browser considers it to be cross-origin, even if both origins are equal. For that reason it sends an OPTIONS request and we need to return a number of headers. We cannot do that inside this Location section, because the directives that make Apache return an empty response also prevent it from returning these headers...

Hence we must add the headers in the main VirtualHost section, like this:

```
    # Send CORS related headers irrespective of Location. Apache won't send these headers for OPTIONS request in which SetHandler is used!
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        SetEnvIf Origin "^https://localhost:5177$" ORIGIN_ALLOWED=$0
        SetEnvIf Origin "^https://mycontexts\.com$" ORIGIN_ALLOWED=$0
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "%{ORIGIN_ALLOWED}e" env=ORIGIN_ALLOWED

        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization, Accept"
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
        Header always set Access-Control-Expose-Headers "Content-Type, Cache-Control, Accept-Ranges, ETag, Server, Accept"
        Header always set Access-Control-Max-Age "3600"
    </IfModule>
```

Here we have enabled a localhost origin for development purposes.

It listens on the port configured with runtime parameter `--port` (in this example taken to be 5988).

It interacts with the RabbitMQ server listening on host `--rabbithost` (default: `localhost`) and port `--rabbitport`.

Set a maximum number of user accounts permitted with parameter `--maxusers`.

Finally, provide the logger level with optional parameter `--level` (default is 'info'). Levels can be:

* error: 0,
* warn: 1,
* info: 2,
* http: 3,
* verbose: 4,
* debug: 5,
* silly: 6

All logging statements with the provided level or lower will end up in the log files. There are two files: `error.log` and `combined.log`. Both are found in the directory from which the process starts.

It uses a RabbitMQ account with management priviliges to access the [management api](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/v3.8.7/priv/www/api/index.html) (but also see [this page](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)). The credentials for this account should be passed in with parameters `--admin` and `--adminpassword`

To access the server, create a POST request and send a payload consisting of this object:

```
{ userName, password, queueName }
```

The userName - password combination will be granted user status of the RabbitMQ server, provided the total number of registered users is not above the threshold configured with the parameter `maxusers`. Moreover, that user will be given exactly the required rights to be able to register the queue and a binding key to it.

The first time that the end user tries to access RabbitMQ with his credentials and tries to register listening to the queue, that queue will be created and the userName is used as binding key for this queue. Consequently, messages sent to `topic/<userName>` will end up in `queueName`.

This allows the service user to create a queue whose identity only it is in the know, while it can invite peers to use `userName` to sent him messages.

## Installing
Install using npm:

```
npm install git+https://github.com/joopringelberg/perspectives-rabbitmq-service.git
```

## Starting the server manually
The server must be started on the same host that runs the RabbitMQ service.

An example of starting the service manually can be found in the shell script `startservice.sh`.

## Making the service a deamon with pm2
To make sure that the service is restarted after system boot, install [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) on the server. Then start this service through pm2 like this:

```
pm2 start selfregister.js -- --port=5988 --rabbithost=localhost --rabbitport=15672 --admin=ADMIN --adminpassword=PASSWORD --maxusers=100 --level=error
```

To stop the service, list the processes, note the name and stop it:
```
pm2 list
pm2 stop selfregister 
```

Restart again with the same command (e.g. with a new password). Afterwards, save the list so that on system reboot, the new password is used:

```
pm2 save
```

## Apache configuration
Even though the PDR consists of scripts in the domain https://mycontexts.com and the perspectives-rabbitmq-service is served from the same domain, because it is requested from within a Service Worker (actually, the SharedWorker running the PDR requests it, but all of its requests are sent through a Service Worker), the browser considers it to be a cross-domain request. For that reason, we need to have Apache send back CORS headers.

It turns out that (at least per december 5, 2024) _credentials in the url_ make Chrome (build 131.0.6778.86) reject the request (giving a minimally worded Cors reason). FireFox (130.0b9) lets it go through.

## Developing
For https://mycontexts.com, the three source files can be copied to `/home/joop/rbsr` with the package script `publish`.

There is a test in the npm package. To test from the command line, use this:

```
curl -X POST https://mycontexts.com/rbsr -k -d '{"userName":"aap","password":"noot","queueName":"mies"}'
```
